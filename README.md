# BrowseGoal Extension

This is a Firefox Extension that lets you set a goal when visiting a distracting website, and then keeps that goal on-screen so you don't forget.


## Dev setup
To test, simply run `web-ext run` from `src/`

To build, run `web-ext build`

If you don't have web-ext, you can get it with `npm install --global web-ext`
